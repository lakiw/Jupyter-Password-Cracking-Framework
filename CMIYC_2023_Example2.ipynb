    "### Creating custom left lists (of hashes) based on metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "With unsalted hashes, it generally doesn't matter if you have a bunch of \"junk\" hashes that you aren't directly targeting in the hashlists that you are cracking. But for salted and computationally expensive hashes, you want to only target hashes that your attacks have been optimized to crack. That's where the idea of targeted \"left lists\" come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the CMIYC 2023 competition, hashed belonging to employees in the Sales department were created with fairly easy to guess passwords. Therefore, let's create a left list that only contains hashes belonging to Sales teammembers. To do this, we'll use the **SessionMgr.create_left_list(is_jtr=True, file_name=None, hash_type=None, filter=None)** function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**is_jtr**: If True, it will format the hashes for John the Ripper cracking sessions. If False it will format them for HashCat.\n",
    "\n",
    "**file_name**: The name/location of the file to write the left-list. If not specified it will output them to stdout.\n",
    "\n",
    "**hash_type**: Allows you to filter the left-list by hashtype. Aka if you want to only create it for bcrypt hashes. If None, then it will output uncracked hashes for all hash types\n",
    "\n",
    "**filter**: A dictionary that contains all the key/value pairs to filter the left list on. If a value is listed as none, it will only filter based on if the key exists for a target containing the uncracked hash. You can specify multiple filters, but currently only one filter per key/value pair. Aka if you want key1:value1 and key1:value2, you can't do that and will need to run this twice and manually combine the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you forget what the categories are that you can filter on, you can always call SessionMgr.print_metadata_categories()\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 2: You'll notice the **semicolon ;** at the end of the sm.create_left_list in the call below. That supresses printing the return value of the function to this Notebook. I'm doing this since create_left_list also returns a list of all the hashes written to disk as its return value as well. This enables more advanced usage of these commands which will be demostrated later in this Notebook."

    "The other thing you often need to do is create wordlists/dictionaries based on previously cracked passwords. This can be used as part of loopback style attacks, but you can also feed these wordlists into other analysis tools like the [PCFG Toolset](https://github.com/lakiw/pcfg_cracker) or [PACK](https://github.com/iphelix/pack).\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge with these competitions is that passwords from each challenge is often generated in a very different manner. This means that if you train on every cracked password it can create rules that don't apply to your targeted list. Therefore the framework's method to generate custom wordlists **SessionMgr.create_cracked_list(self, file_name=None, hash_type=None, filter=None)** has the same filtering ability/format as the method to **create_left_list()**. The only difference is that while create_left_list() generates a list of uncrackes hashes, create_cracked_list() creates a wordlist of cracked plaintext values."

    "### Advanced Hashcat Association Attack Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's get into more advanced use-cases. Specifically let's dig into generating custom wordlists and hashlists to support a Hashcat association attack **(-a9 mode)**. This is detailed more in this blog post (also listed above) [Advanced Hashcat Techniques](https://reusablesec.blogspot.com/2023/08/hashcat-tips-and-tricks-for-hacking.html). For CMIYC2023 a set of passwords were generated by converting the \"Created\" timestamp to a Unix epoc timestamp. To speed things up when cracking a high value/high cost hash like BCrypt, Hashcat can run a 1 to 1 attack of hash/guess which is what an association attack does. To generate a matching hashlist + wordlist for this you can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create the hash_list\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code will create a left list of all uncracked bcrypt hashes. You'll notice we are also saving the results of this call to the variable bcrypt_hashes. This way we can later generate a matching wordlist. Also you'll notice we're filtering it so only hashes with a \"Created\" metadata field are being saved. Since it is **{\"Created\":None)** with **None** as the value it will save all hashes that have the field regardless of the field's value."
