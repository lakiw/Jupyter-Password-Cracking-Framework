    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to make it easy as possible for you to get a team registered and ready to participate in CMIYC. I'm hopefull I'll be updating it a lot running up to the contest, so I'd recommend using this as an example, but creating your own notebook to manage your teams cracking sessions. That way you don't have to worry about merge conflicts or overwriting your own work.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's face it. PGP is a pain, and you don't want to have to try and figure it out during the contest. But all communication with the organizers (KoreLogic) needs to be done via PGP encrypted messages. This includes creating a team and submitting hashes. To make this easier, I created some functions to help using the Python3 **pgpy** library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first function is **generate_read_pgp_private_key**. This will create a new PGP key (if one does not already exit) and write it to the key_file name that you send to it. If a PGP key already exists it'll validate the key and then return it. This way you aren't creating a new key every time this is run. Feel free to skip using this function if you already have a PGP key you want to use, but even the conference organizers recommend using a contest specific PGP key to make it easier to partner with other players."

    "Now here is a point where I'm going to recommend that you do something different than what I'm doing in this Notebook. Registering a team and unpacking contest hashes are really one-time events per contest. Having them in a notebook makes them easy to run and debug which is nice, but as we move on to actually cracking hashes we'll start doing tasks which we'll be repeating a lot. Aka loading up and managing POT files, generating new rulesets, analyzing new cracks. Therefore it will add a lot to your quality of life to put those tasks in a different Notebook from the previous one-time \"setup\" tasks. That way when you reload your crack management notebook you won't have to re-run these one-time tasks that no longer matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I'm not going to do that since this is more of a tutorial, and splitting up a tutorial into multiple Notebooks will make it easeir to follow and learn from. But just keep that in mind as you set up your own cracking sessions."
