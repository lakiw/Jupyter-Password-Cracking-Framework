# Jupyter-Password-Cracking-Framework
A JupyterLab notebook with functionality to help manage password cracking sessions. Specifically geared towards helping with password cracking competitions.

Warning: This is very early in development. I expect I'll be changing around a lot of the backend data structures significantly as I build out capabilities and get a better idea of how I'm using this. Also I haven't yet ported over a lot of core functionality that I was using in the Jupyter Notebooks I wrote for the CMIYC competition. Basically I'm rewriting everything from scratch to make a more sustainable and extensible framework for other people to use.

Long story short, depending on what commit I just merged this framework likely doesn't work, and it certainly isn't mature enough in its current state to be useful.
